Code done by Ralph Gleaton (me) can predominantly be found in regex.java

This directory contains the source files for the three utilities to
support the CSCE 355 programming project.

The three executable utilities are:

  - in2post - converts infix regexes to the corresponding postfix
  - pre2in  - converts prefix regexes to the corresponding infix
  - revline - prints the tokens on the line in reverse

These utilities are meant to run on linux-like systems but should be
adaptable to other systems.

Each utility reads a sequence of zero or more lines from standard
input and outputs the results, line by line, to standard output.
The input can be typed in from a keyboard (end with Ctrl-D on an empty
line) or redirected from a text file.  Spaces and tabs on the input
are ignored and omitted from the output.  All text starting with '#'
and going to the end of the line is considered a comment and is
ignored.

PIPING:
Using standard input/output makes it convenient to pipe the output of
one utility to the input of another.  Using pipes allows for more
possible conversions:

To convert from infix to prefix:
    in2post | revline | pre2in | in2post | revline

To convert from postfix to infix:
    revline | pre2in | in2post | revline | pre2in

To convert from prefix to postfix:
    pre2in | in2post

To convert from postfix to prefix:
    revline | pre2in | in2post | revline

Each pipe above conforms to the following two rules:
   - the number of revline's in the pipe must be even
   - revline should never take infix expressions as input (line
     reversal only makes sense for prefix and postfix expressions)

Files:

Makefile - controls the build (just type `make')
in2post.c   - main source for in2post
pre2in.c    - main source for pre2in
revline.c   - main source for revline
token.[ch]  - tokenizer utility used by the three programs above

These programs are written in C and should be highly portable, making
minimal platform-related assumptions.  The Makefile assumes gcc is
available, but any reasonable C compiler should suffice.
